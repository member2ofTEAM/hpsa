figure out time stuff
	can we win by having the other time just time out before us?
	do we have to send a move every tick or just the change?

figure out a simple (100 lines) and readable implementation of the game
	hunter
	prey
	board
	encode everything as change in direction?
	queue for moves
	N determines the max number of steps we can look ahead
	implement greedy strategy for the hunter
		make sure the hunter and prey remain in the same box
			when building a wall
		build the wall as fast as possible while fullfilling that
			constraint
